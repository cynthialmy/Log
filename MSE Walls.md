Basis of Design

Information Provided by Roadway
•	Plan view: Wall Reference Line (Front Face of Wall) and Begin / End of Wall
o	Confirmed definition of Wall Ref Line is Front Face of Wall
•	Wall profiles: Existing Ground, Proposed Grade in Front of Wall, Proposed Grade behind Wall
o	The top of wall elevation shown from roadway is the asterisk point for ditch with 2:1 slope per GDOT construction detail D-49 Paved Ditch (attachment). Larger ditch may be used as drainage area requires.
o	The top of wall shown from roadway is by assuming there is no ditch behind the wall

Bottom of Wall
Per GDOT 5.5.3.1.4, the top of leveling pad elevation shall be at least 2’ below the bottom of an adjacent ditch and maintain a minimum of 10’ berm in front of the wall. The slope in front of wall need to be confirm by section cuts. Now assuming the slope is greater than 5:1. For walls adjacent to traffic, the slope in front of wall is larger than 5:1, the top of levelling pad elevation is set 2’ below the proposed grade.
Top of Wall
Under bridge
•	Per GDOT 5.5.3.2.1, the top of wall elevation directly in front of bridge abutments should be approximately 1’ above the bottom of the end bent cap.
•	Per GDOT 5.5.3.2.2, set break points at the top of the wall for 10’ minimum beyond the wingwall (GDOT Figure 5.5.3.2.2-1)
•	Per GDOT 5.5.3.2.4,
Coping type H
•	The top of wall elevation is the gutter line per GDOT Fig, 5.5.3.1.9-1
Coping type B
•	The top of wall elevation is the top of sidewalk line per GDOT Fig, 5.5.3.1.9-1 (Confirmed with Xavier R. on 2/26/2020).
Coping type A
•	The top of wall elevation is 1’ above the Proposed Grade at back of Wall by assuming there is no ditch.
•	The top of wall elevation is 2’-6” above the Proposed Grade behind Wall provided by Roadway per GDOT Standard D-49.
Staged Construction
Per GDOT 5.5.3.2.4, if an abutment wall will be constructed beneath a bridge being constructed in stages, vertical joint shall be detailed on the construction drawings at the stage line.

In plan view: 1. begin and end sta. of wall; 2. Offset; 3. front face of wall; 
In elevation view: 1. top of wall; 2. proposed ground at back of wall; 3. proposed ground at front of wall; 4. existing ground; 5. top of footing; 6. elevations of top and bottom limits of wall at: - wall begin and end; - major break points; - staging lines; - 50 ft. intervals.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Stations are beter to be eve numbers.
Check length of wall
Check height > 3.5 ft
Utilities
Length should be calculated from stations
Look at cross sections will help with understanding lines in plan view
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

If the wall is connected to the 6-S (if 6-S is needed to suppport, not too short/unnecessary), 6-S limits are 11.5' (FINISHED GRADE TO TOP OF WALL). 
- Extend MSE wall to 11.5ft from finished grade in front to top of wall.

If the wall is not connected to a standard type wall (6-S), there will be a 13' long segment for transition. The segment is not a wall. In this case the MSE wall height limits are 3.5 ft (finished grade to top of wall). 
- End MSE wall where Top of Coping to Finished Grade < 3.5 ft.
- Extend MSE wall to 3.5ft from finished grade in front to top of wall.

Try to use a round number (for stations and wall lengths)
Make sure dimensions are measured along face of wall.

THINGS SHOULDED HAVE BEEN CHECKED DURING CONSTUCTBILITY.

THE REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT CLEAR.

EACH COORDIINATION IS TIME CONSUMING

DEPENDING ON THE GRADING, WE CAN SET THE BEGIN/END OF WALL, WALL TYPE.
EVERY ADJUSTMENT NEEDS TO BE COORDINATED BETWEEN THREE TO FOUR PEOPLE
