# Reinforced Concrete
## 1. Strut-and-tie models
**ACI 318** deep beam

*Procedure:*
  * *reactions on the model*
  * *location of the members by aligning the direction of structs in the direction of the anticipated cracking*
  * *areas of the struts, ties and nodes necessary to provide the required strength*
  * *provide anchorage for the ties*
  * *provide crack control reinforcement*
  
**effective compressive strength** Sec. A.3.2
-> **nominal compressive strength**
Ties are tesion members
anchorage must be provided by means of end plates or hooks pt development length
F.nt = A.ts*f.y
