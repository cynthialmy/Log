This project involves the replacement of the existing SR 29 bridge over
Pughes Creek in Laurens County, Georgia. The project begins at Station
9+00 and continues southeast approximately 0.42 miles, crossing over
Pughes Creek, to Station 33+00. The construction limits are from Station
10+68 to 30+72. The proposed bridge extends from Station 19+35 to
Station 21+65. The new bridge is proposed to be a five-span, six-bent
structure about 230 feet long and 40 feet wide supporting one traffic lane
in each direction. The new bridge will be constructed just downstream of
the existing bridge, parallel to the existing bridge alignment

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RCPIER
• A three spans: 150’-75’-75’model was developed to design intermediate bents at bent 2 and bent 3. Intermediate bents are 2-column bents with 5 piles per footing under each column.
• Base design for all elements for Strength Group I, III and V & Service Group I.
Bent Caps
• Actual Cap Width = 40’ 
• Bent 2 Cap Size = 48” x 54”; Bent 3 C Cap Size = 48” x 48”
• In the model the cap width was set to be 43.25’ (out-out deck width) for a valid geometry input. Upward forces were applied on two ends in DC1 to balance out the additional weight.
• Additional distributed force and moment were applied for the cap step on Bent 2, which supports the different beam size in span 1 & 2.
• Bent 2 main bars are controlled by bottom flexural. Two layers of #11bars were used at the bottom, with eight bars on the first layer and two bars as the second layer, to meet 5” spacing limit. Eight #11 bars were used as top main bars.
• The cap size is controlled by shear & torsion. 4-legs of #6 Stirrups were used to meet the 5” stirrup spacing limit, GDOT 4.4.1.2.4.
Bent Columns
• Column size = 36’ x 36’
• The column spacing is set to 23.75’ to balance the flexural forces on two sides of each column.
Bent Footings
• Footing size = 10.5’ x 10.5’
• Footing depth = 45”
• Layout of the five HP piles were set based on GDOT Appendix 4B and Footing Geometry spreadsheet. Service strength was increased and set to 405kips for Bent 2 piles in RCPIER. Strength capacity is sufficient for piles.
