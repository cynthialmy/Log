# Step to Design a Bridge
start with geometry
geometry information from roadway
horizontal curve and vertical curve
## Superstructure
## Substructure
It is better to do the substructure after super structure to get the load cases.
- Cap
- Column
- Footing (Piles)
Footing layout can be optimized. Width and Length of the footing can be reduced if the uplifting force is close to 0.
Also need to check pile capacity for strength load cases. Service load cases are not as important.

# Project Thoughts
- MSE goemetry calcs
- elevations under bridge
- wall length with curve
- offset, station, radius -> length

I'm a bridge guy whose been in the field for about 6 years, and have my PE. I also have a brother who is a licensed architect (been in the field about 15 years now, I think) with whom I've spoken at great length about various projects, so I think I could offer some insight.

Day to day work for me is roughly evenly split between inspection (field) work and analysis (office) work. It varies, depending on the season / inspection cycles offered by the various Departments of Transportation (DOTs). Actual new design work is few and far between; most of the analytical work I do is what's known as load rating (an example here) with a few rehabilitation projects here and there (i.e. a bridge deck replacement, repair details of corroded members, or even a full superstructure replacement). It can be an interesting challenge interpreting hand drawn plans from the 1930's while trying to figure out if a structure can support current-day loadings :)

The analytical work I do is primarily done with proprietary programs (as I'm sure is also done with building engineers) such as Bentley's RCPier or CONSPAN. For all things which don't have a standardized industry-accepted program, though, that's when we need to go back to engineering fundamentals and develop an Excel spreadsheet for the design/analysis. Again, I'm sure the process is similar for building engineers.

As far as transitioning from building to bridge and vice versa, my conversations with my brother and his dealings with building engineers have definitely reminded me that all the principles are the same: as /u/lect mentioned:

Figure out a load path, design per code(s), and make sure that whatever you propose is feasible.

The primary codes for bridge guys (in the US, at least) would be AASHTO, with the occasional references to AISC, ACI, PCI, etc. The primary codes for building guys (as I understand it) would be the IBC and ASCE7 (with the same occasional references to AISC, ACI, PCI, etc). But all the principles are the same: produce a feasible concept, figure out the loads/load paths, design it to code. That said, I've never known someone who's been exclusive to one of the fields for a couple years and decide to switch to the other.

You could specialize in computer field with Civil Engineeering related problems and you will be an expert in both disciplines. In Civil Engineering, I would like you to specialize in Geotechnical Engineering, Geosynthetic Engineering, Design of structures under dynamic Loadings like Seismic loading, hydrodynamic loading, Reliability Analysis as these are newly emerging challenges and have great potential in future. Further, you should be armed with tools of Finite Element Analysis, Statistical Learning and Machine Intelligence. This will make you an expert in Civil Engineering with software skills. I would advise you try to learn Python and R as they are very simple and elegant to learn. Join any course on EDx, Coursera or Udacity on Python and R. After you would have specialized in these languages, also try to learn RMarkdown and Jupyter notebook as these will help you to share your ideas with your professional network. You will get confidence in your work after publishing those work. Try to develop interest in data science and join Microsoft Cortana Analytics' free account and specifically Azure ML. This will help you to integrate your skills in Python, R and bit of SQL and let you publish your work on the web very easily. Learn Abaqus and Matlab for mastering your skills in FEM. Try to solve problems related with Civil Engineering and in short time you will find that you are able to solve any damn structural problem - you can design a tunnel or an offshore foundation or an aircraft very easily. You can use data analysis to solve a non-deterministic problems and develop machine learning tools with them like pollution problem in cities and its solution, green building concept, seismic resistant structures, optimization of construction etc. Remember, you are at an advantage when compared with a software engineer as you are an specialist while he/she is just a general professional. You can do better in your profession better by devloping analytical skills required in software engineering.
