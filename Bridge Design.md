# Step to Design a Bridge
start with geometry
geometry information from roadway
horizontal curve and vertical curve
## Superstructure
## Substructure
It is better to do the substructure after super structure to get the load cases.
- Cap
- Column
- Footing (Piles)
Footing layout can be optimized. Width and Length of the footing can be reduced if the uplifting force is close to 0.
Also need to check pile capacity for strength load cases. Service load cases are not as important.

# Project Thoughts
- MSE goemetry calcs
- elevations under bridge
- wall length with curve
- offset, station, radius -> length
