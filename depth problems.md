## Q21
**ASCE7 Sec12.14** simplified seismic design

## Q22
* **ASCE7** flat snow load exceed 30 psf, the effective seismic weight shall include 20% of the uniform snow load
* **IBC Chap.16** seismic base shear as direcrly proportional to effective seismic weight **W**.
* regular floor plan is better for seismic
* it is prefered to have a more flexible story above a stiffer one

## Q23
* **AISC Steel Construction Manual** section properties and thermal expansions
* *P.th = Î±(T.2-T.1)AE* to get the axial load, use the thermal coeff for **Steel**

## Q24 Center of Rigidity
* Based on the relative areas of the walls
* Also the relatice stiffness, which is proportional to the inverse of the shear and flexual deflection *h/L<=0.25* 
or gerter than 0.25 to 4,
